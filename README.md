The Medicardio Application for Heart Disease Risk Assessment remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitating early and accurate risk assessment for effective prevention and management. The Medicardio Application leverages machine learning, specifically the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, to predict an individual's heart disease risk based on clinical and lifestyle factors. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as an effective tool for diagnosing heart disease by analyzing vital health parameters such as body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. This project proposes the use of a Random Forest technique as a core component of a computer-aided diagnostic system designed to accurately predict the risk of heart disease. By applying this method, the system not only predicts risk levels but also sends real-time alerts to healthcare providers and guardians, including the patient's location details. The Random Forest algorithm, known for its strong classification capabilities, was employed to predict medication adherence in CVD patients and stratify them for better management. To improve the model's performance, The experimental results demonstrate that the Random Forest model achieved an impressive accuracy of 88.5% during validation.The findings highlight the potential of ML-driven approaches in enhancing the accuracy of heart disease risk prediction, offering valuable insights for healthcare practitioners to make informed decisions and provide timely interventions.
